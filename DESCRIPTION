Description: Tspecies uses a pre-fitted GAM model to predict Ne based on a 
    given Ks value and a neutral mutation rate miu. The Ks refers to a vector 
    representing d/L, where d is the base difference between sequences, and L is 
    the sequence length. We will corrected the Ks value automatically by using 
    multiple substitution and 2Ne based on our data.
