Description: Tspecies uses a pre-fitted GAM model or formula to predict Ne based
    on a given Ks value and a neutral mutation rate miu (the unit of miu is per 
    site per generation). The Ks refers to a vector representing d/L, where d is
    the base difference between sequences, and L is the sequence length. We will
    corrected the Ks value automatically by using multiple substitution and 2Ne 
    based on our data (attention if the Ks value has been already corrected). 
    Additionally, there is another function named 'TspeciesPlot' which can be 
    used to create a plot of Ks distribution.
